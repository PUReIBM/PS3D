!    PUReIBM-PS3D is a three-dimensional psudeo-spectral particle-resolved
!    direct numerical simulation solver for detailed analysis of homogeneous
!    fixed and freely evolving fluid-particle suspensions. PUReRIBM-PS3D
!    is a continuum Navier-Stokes solver based on Cartesian grid that utilizes
!    Immeresed Boundary method to represent particle surfuces.
